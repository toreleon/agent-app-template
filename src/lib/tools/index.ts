/**
 * The full set of tools available to the chat agent. Order is not significant;
 * the model chooses which (if any) to call.
 *
 * The hosted web-search tool serializes as the OpenAI `web_search_preview` tool
 * type, which is only supported by the public OpenAI Responses API. Azure /
 * OpenAI-compatible endpoints reject unknown tool types and would 400 the entire
 * request, so we only register it when no custom `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is set.
 *
 * The portable `web_search` function tool (webSearchFunctionTool) is always
 * registered — it runs against a pluggable, mostly keyless backend, so the agent
 * has real search everywhere. It returns lightweight title/url/snippet results;
 * the agent reads a page's contents with `web_fetch` (webFetchTool).
 *
 * The coding-sandbox tools (read_file, list_dir, grep_search, edit_file,
 * write_file, run_shell) operate on a confined per-conversation workspace at
 * `.workspaces/<conversationId>/repo`. They are portable function tools, so they
 * are registered unconditionally. The conversationId is threaded to them via the
 * Agents SDK RunContext (see src/lib/agent.ts), never from a model argument, so a
 * model can only touch its own conversation's workspace.
