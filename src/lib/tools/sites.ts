/**
 * The Site tools (ChatGPT-Sites-style publishing). Like the artifact tools these
 * are mostly "capture" tools: create_site / update_site carry the page payload
 * out of the model, and the /api/chat route intercepts them to persist the draft,
 * version it, and stream a `site` event to the panel (see src/lib/sites.ts).
 *
 * deploy_site is special: whether it actually publishes depends on the user's
 * `sitesAutoDeploy` opt-in, so its `execute` reads the RunContext userId and
 * returns an ACCURATE acknowledgement (the model must know whether it published
 * or merely saved a candidate). The real DB work still happens in the chat route.
 *
 * Keep the tool `name` values in sync with SITE_TOOL_NAMES in @/lib/types.
